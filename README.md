This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and professional links.  
It is built using HTML and CSS, and features a clean layout with responsive design.  
The homepage includes an introduction, a profile picture, and a short summary about me.  
Navigation links lead to my LinkedIn, Instagram, HackerRank, and a downloadable "About Me" PDF.  
The projects section highlights a digital art achievement and lists key programming skills.  
Icons from Font Awesome are used to make the interface more visual and engaging.  
The footer provides contact details and social media icons for easy connection.  
This site reflects my passion for front-end development and data-driven technologies.
